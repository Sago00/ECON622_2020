# Problem Sets

Problem sets should be submitted as a *single* Jupyter notebook on Canvas, with the code and output clean.
- **Problem Set 1** - Due Thursday September 17th
  - Exercises 7, 8(a), and 8(b) in [Introductory Examples](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started_julia/julia_by_example.html)
  - Redo any exercise of your choice from 1 to 6 in [Introductory Examples](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started_julia/julia_by_example.html)
    - In all "Redo" look at the provided solutions afterwards, but still submit your code
  - Exercise 7 in [Julia Essentials](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started_julia/julia_essentials.html)
- **Problem Set 2** - Due Thursday September 24th
  - Unlike the first assignment, we will start grading this on style and reproducibility rather than just on whether you get the correct numbers.  See the [Digression on Style and Naming](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started_julia/introduction_to_types.html#A-Digression-on-Style-and-Naming)
  - Exercises 2, 3, and 4 in [Fundamental Types](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started_julia/fundamental_types.html)
  - Exercises 1, 2, and 3 in [Introduction to Types](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started_julia/introduction_to_types.html)
- **Problem Set 3** - Due Thursday October 1st
  - Exercises 4, 5, 6 in [Introduction to Types](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started_julia/introduction_to_types.html)
- **Problem Set 4:** Due Thursday, October 8th
  - Exercise 1 in [Generic Programming](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/more_julia/generic_programming.html)
  - Exercise 1 in [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON622_2019/blob/master/notebooks/numerical_linear_algebra.ipynb)
  - Exercises 1a, 1b, 1c  in [Git and Github](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/more_julia/version_control.html)
    - For the git/github in your ipynb notebook add links to the various PRs or screenshots with some evidence that you executed the steps.  No need to do much about the formatting
    - The easiest is certainly if you do all of this with public github repos, and then you can just provide links to the "evidence"
- **Problem Set 5:** Due Thursday, October 22nd
  - Exercise 1 in [Testing and Packages](https://julia.quantecon.org/more_julia/testing.html) also consider doing exercise 2, which is watching a video, perhaps first
    
  
### From Last Year 

These will likely be largely reused this year.
  
- **Problem Set 6:** Due Monday, October 28th
  - Complete one of the exercises from [optimization algorithms](https://schrimpf.github.io/AnimatedOptimization.jl/exercises/) Turn in a link to a public git repo containing your work (preferred) or a jupyter notebook.
  
- **Problem Set 7:** Due Monday, November 4th
  - Work on one of the issues in [GMMInference.jl](https://github.com/schrimpf/GMMInference.jl/issues). 
    - If you have a GMM model you're interested in, Issue #7 would be a good choice
    - If you are interested in econometric theory, issues #5 and the second bullet of #8 are good and will require some research
    - If you like thinking about code organization and package design, #2 or #6 are relevant
  - As with the previous assignment, you need not complete the task; make whatever progress you can in 6 hours or so. If you want your work to be added to the repository, either make a pull request or say so on whatever you turn in. 

- **Problem Set 8:** Due Wednesday, November 13th
  - Improve the performance of a piece of code. Take some code from a package, previous assignment, or lecture and attempt to improve its performance. Include benchmarks of the initial version and your modified version. Briefly describe the things you tried.
